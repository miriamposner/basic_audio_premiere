# basic_audio_premiere

This is a step-by-step tutorial (access it on [this page](https://github.com/miriamposner/basic_audio_premiere/blob/main/basic_audio_editing_in_premiere.md)) designed for my undergraduate students that relays the basics of editing audio in Adobe Premiere Pro. It's designed to take about 60 minutes and follows a [previous tutorial](https://github.com/miriamposner/digital_storytelling_adobe_premiere) on the basics of editing with Premiere Pro.
